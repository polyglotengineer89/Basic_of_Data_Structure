What is Hash Table
------------------
* A Hash Table is a data structure
* Offer fast insertion and searching
* they are limited in size because they are based on arrays
        * can be resized, but should be avoided
* they are hard to order

Hash table & hash functions
---------------------------
 * Key values are assigned to elements in hash Table using a hash function

 * a hash function helps calculate the best index an item should go in
     * index must be small enough for the arrays size
     * Dont overwrite other data in hash table
