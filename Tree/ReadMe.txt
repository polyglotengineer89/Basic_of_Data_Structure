what is Tree?      |||
===========================
A tree is a Hierarchical data structure that naturally hierarchically stores the information. The Tree data structure is one of the most efficient and mature. The nodes connected by the edges are represented.

    ===========================
    Type of Tree:       |||
    ===========================
    * General Tree
    * Binary Tree
    * Binary Search Tree
    * AVL Tree(Not included)
    * Red-Black Tree(Not Included)
    ===========================
    what is General Tree?    |||
    ===========================  
    If no constraint is placed on the tree’s hierarchy, a tree is called a general tree.
    
    ===========================
    what is Binary Tree?    |||
    ===========================  
    The binary tree is the kind of tree in which most two children can be found for each parent. The kids are known as the left kid and right kid.   

    A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree

    ==================================
    what is Search Binary Tree?    |||
    ================================== 
    Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree extension with several optional restrictions. The left child value of a node should in BST be less than or equal to the parent value, and the right child value should always be greater than or equal to the parent’s value. This

===========================
why we do need a Tree?|
===========================
1. The tree reflects the data structural connections.
2. The tree is used for hierarchy.
3. It offers an efficient search and insertion procedure.
4. The trees are flexible. This allows subtrees to be relocated with minimal effort.
