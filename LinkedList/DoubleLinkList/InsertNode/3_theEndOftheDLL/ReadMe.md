The new node is always added after the last node of the given Linked List

==========
Example?|
==========
if the given DLL is 510152025 and we add an item 30 at the end, then the DLL becomes 51015202530.
Since a Linked List is typically represented by the head of it, we have to traverse the list till end and then change the next of last node to new node.
