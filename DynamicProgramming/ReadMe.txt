================================
what is Dynamic Programming? |||
================================
Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an 
optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing 
the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon 
the optimal solution to its subproblems.
